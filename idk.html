<h3>Will I be the next president who can make Dog Squad way much better?</h3>
<h4>I promise to do my best as the president and bring more peace and <del>life</del><ins>prosperity!</ins><h4>
    and here are the lists of the things I will promise to do!<br><br>
  
</p>
  <b>LIST</b>
  <ul>
    
    
    <li><details><summary>Peace&Prosperity</summary><p>
      I as soon to be the next president will try my hardest to bring peace and prosperity by making laws and make the group chat lively!
      
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><details><summary>Better rules and laws</summary><p>
     The rules and laws I shall approve and make will mainly focus on acknowledging games and being happy and stuffs.
    </p></li>
    <li><details><summary>Removal of taxes</summary><p>
      Taxes seems too unnecessary so I will try my best to remove it or change it and make it better.
      
    </p></li>
    <li><details><summary>Change of system</summary><p>
      I will focus on changing the system like decreasing the term of the presidents how to be eligible as the next president and many more when I become the president.
      
    </p></li>
    <li><details><summary>Invitation of more people to the fun</summary><p>
      We may allow some foreigners/people not from "THE BOYS", to join the DOG SQUAD but note that they are the ones who can easily get terminated out as well(they have to be extra careful with how theyre talking). They do not belong to most things beside chatting they cannot use any laws against ones from the dog squad and breaking a law would be an instant termination(for the safety, fun, and freedom of the local people from Dog Squad). </p></li>
    <li><details><summary><del>funny racist memes</del><ins>Support memes</ins></summary><p>
      I will allow and support good memes but spamming it will decrease your charisma.</p></li>
    <li><details><summary>Proper punishment</summary><p>
      It seems like there is no justice for the people in the group chat and people just freely talk without knowing what others feel and if they are doing a good behaviour.</p></li>
